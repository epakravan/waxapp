# Netlify Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Files Ready for Deployment

- `index.html` - Main application
- `styles.css` - All styling
- `script.js` - Firebase-powered JavaScript
- `firebase-config.js` - Production Firebase credentials
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- `.nvmrc` - Node.js version specification
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` - Firebase setup guide

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose GitHub and select your repository
   - Branch: `main` (or whatever your main branch is)
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: (leave empty or set to `.`)
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Click on the generated URL
   - Test logging a t-shirt entry
   - Refresh page to confirm data persists

## 🔥 Firebase Configuration

✅ **Already Configured**:
- Project: `waxapp-ff7c2`
- Firestore database enabled
- Real-time listeners active
- Security rules (should be set to allow read/write)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If data doesn't persist**:
1. Check Firebase console for Firestore rules
2. Ensure rules allow read/write access
3. Check browser console for Firebase errors

**If site doesn't load**:
1. Check Netlify build logs
2. Verify all files are in repository
3. Check `netlify.toml` configuration

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- ✅ Site loads on Netlify URL
- ✅ Can log t-shirt entries
- ✅ Data persists after refresh
- ✅ Real-time updates work
- ✅ Calendar shows entries correctly
- ✅ Statistics update properly

## 📱 Share with Team

Once deployed, share your Netlify URL with team members:
- Example: `https://amazing-app-name.netlify.app`
- Everyone can log David's t-shirt days collaboratively!
- Changes appear in real-time across all users
